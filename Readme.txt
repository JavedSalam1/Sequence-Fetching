# Protein Sequence Retrieval Script

This Python script fetches protein sequences from UniProt based on names provided in a CSV file.

## Overview

The script reads a CSV file containing protein names, retrieves their sequences from UniProt using the bioservices library, and updates the CSV with the retrieved sequences.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed. Install necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas bioservices
